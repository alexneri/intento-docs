# Translation Portal

The [Translation Portal](https://portal.inten.to/) lets you try different Machine Translation (MT) engines without programming. You can also embed the Translation Portal in internal sites, portals, and more.

## Translating a file

To quickly begin translating do the following:

1. Select a routing mode in the **Translate with** field. [Smart Routing](https://help.inten.to/hc/en-us/articles/360016598320-Intento-Smart-Routing) is selected in the **Translate with** by default.
2. Select a language pair to translate with in the **From** and **To** fields.
   - If a language pair is already selected, you can click the **Reverse** button to reverse the **From** and **To** fields to swap the language pair.
3. Click the **Upload** button to upload your file. Alternatively, you can drag and drop your file in the upload box.
   - Supported formats are TXT, HTML, XML, CSV, DOCX, and XLSX.
   - To use PPTX, PDF, and SRT formats, consult our team before use.
