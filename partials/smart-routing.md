# Intento Smart Routing

Using Smart Routing sends your translation request to one of the 9 top-performing MT systems from most recent [Machine Translation Report](https://inten.to/machine-translation-report-2024/) with several important features:

* The requests are routed only to cost-effective systems (<$25 per 1M characters). Different MT engines have differing prices.
* We route to systems with full data protection and confidentiality.
* We route only to stable and reliable commercial systems.
* For language pairs that are not in the report, we extrapolate.

If you need a custom routing schema because the MT engine ranking is different for your domain or if you need to route requests to your custom NMT engines , contact us at [hello@inten.to](mailto:hello@inten.to) and we’ll help to set it up.

We support domain routing. For more information, see [Domain-Specific Routing](domain-specific-routing).
