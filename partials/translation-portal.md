# Translation Portal

The [Translation Portal](https://portal.inten.to/) lets you try different Machine Translation (MT) engines without programming. You can also embed the Translation Portal in internal sites, portals, and more.

## Translating a file

To translate a file do the following:

1. Select a routing mode in the **Translate with** field. [Smart Routing](https://help.inten.to/hc/en-us/articles/360016598320-Intento-Smart-Routing) is enabled by default. The list of available translation engines change depending on the selected language pair.
2. Select a language pair to translate with in the **From** and **To** fields.
   - If a language pair is already selected, you can click the **Reverse** button to reverse the **From** and **To** fields to swap the language pair.
3. Click the **Upload** button to upload your file. Alternatively, you can drag and drop your file in the upload box.
   - Supported formats are TXT, HTML, XML, CSV, DOCX, and XLSX.
   - Maximum upload size is 25000000 bytes or roughly 24 MB (23,8) per file, regardless of format.
   - To use PPTX, PDF, and SRT formats, consult our team before use.
4. Click **Translate**. Translation takes at about 2000ms per file.

Previously translated files can be downloaded from the Translated files section.


## Smart Routing

Leaving the Translate with field blank wil automatically select **Smart Routing** by default.

Using Smart Routing sends your translation request to one of the 9 top-performing MT systems from most recent [Machine Translation Report](https://inten.to/machine-translation-report-2024/) with several important features:

* The requests are routed only to cost-effective systems (<$25 per 1M characters). Different MT engines can have higher prices.
* We route to systems with full data protection and confidentiality.
* We route only to stable and reliable commercial systems.
* In some cases, we have identified that ranking on private data differs from ranking for public WMT datasets in the report. We use those insights.
* For language pairs that are not in the report, we extrapolate.
